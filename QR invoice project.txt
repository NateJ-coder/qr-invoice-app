ðŸš€ QR Invoice Generator â€” Progress Snapshot
We are building a dynamic invoice system for service providers that:

Allows providers to fill out a web-based invoice form.

Automatically generates a QR code linked to a client-specific invoice page.

Displays a clean, styled invoice with a "Pay Now" button (payment integration pending).

âœ… Current Features Completed:
Invoice Creation Form at /create-invoice.

Dynamic invoice storage (temporary in-memory for MVP).

Auto-generation of unique invoice IDs.

QR code generation after submitting the form.

Client-facing invoice page accessible via QR or direct link.

ðŸš§ Next Steps:
Integrate Payment Gateway (e.g., PayFast, Yoco).

Add PDF invoice generation (auto-download or email).

Store invoices in a more permanent solution (JSON file or lightweight database).

Deploy app online (using Vercel, Render, etc.).

Optional: Build a proper frontend with React for service provider dashboards.
